# my_daily_roadmap_to_learn_cs_core_subjects
I created this repository as a public learning log of my daily journey. It's not just for tracking my own progressâ€”but also to guide my juniors at IIIT Surat (and others) 
#ðŸ“š Daily CS Core Learning â€“ 4th August 2025
ðŸ§  Fuzzy Logic & Neural Networks (CS514)
ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered:
Supervised Learning

Learning using data that already has answers (labels).

Example: Classifying emails as spam or not.

Unsupervised Learning

Learning from data that has no labels or answers.

Example: Grouping similar customers together.

Reinforcement Learning

Learning by trying actions and getting rewards or punishments.

Example: A robot learning to walk.

Semi-Supervised Learning

Learning using a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.

Example: Categorizing articles with only a few labeled examples.

ðŸ“Š Data Science
ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered:
Simpsonâ€™s Paradox

Sometimes, the overall data shows a different trend than individual parts.

Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)

A way to find relationships between two sets of things.

Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

A method to guess the best values for something based on data.
